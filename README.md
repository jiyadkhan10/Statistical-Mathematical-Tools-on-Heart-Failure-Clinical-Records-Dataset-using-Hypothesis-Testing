# Task

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs. <br />

<br />

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. <br />

<br />

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia or already established disease) need early detection and management. <br />

<br />

You are required to answer the following questions by using hypothesis testing. None of the questions can be answered as Yes or No. You are required to setup and run the experiments to reach a conclusion. Ensure that your conclusions are sound by keeping in mind the Dos and Don'ts for each concept. All the intermediate steps, graphs and experimental results must be included while answering. <br />

# Dataset

This dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. <br />
